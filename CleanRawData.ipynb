It uses the datetime module to get the current time in UTC and convert it to the local time.

    "The next block applies the convert_posted_at_to_local_time() function to the 'metadata' column of the DataFrame and creates a new column 'posted_date' that contains the converted local posted date. It also creates a new column 'scraped_date' that contains the current Montreal time as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script then prints the minimum and maximum posted date to verify that the conversion is working properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSV File Saving\n",

    "\n",
